# Race Augmentation

Available on any race.

Use the race building rules on page 22.

Take -2 for the Wanted (Major) edge. Build as normal or take a single power.

**Take a single power:** Use the No Power Points rules on page 95.

# Bonus Edges

## +1 Reclaimer Tech (Weird Science)

Taking this edge indicates you have found or otherwise acquired a Preserver item that works. Either from the Reclaimers, or a broken item fixed from loot.

Rolls are made using whatever's natural, or "Reclaimer Tech" if there's nothing relevant.
